# Discord Activity - Poker Night
Discord has been launching Games in VC one by one. *Poker Night is an exclusive game which is still in beta testing and only available to discord.gg/discordgameslab.* However, with over 20 games going on at once in one server, it causes extreme lag. **This code brings this game to any server.**
This is another variant of *Chess in the Park* stated in discord-chess-activity.

You need to startup the bot to be able to play this game in your server.

### Bot Startup Instructions for Beginners
1. Go to discord.com/developers, create an application.
2. Open IDLE on your PC, copy main.py.
3. Replace "TOKEN_HERE" with your bot token, which you will find in your application details.
4. Run the Code.

### Usage
- Run `sc!poker` after joining a VC
- Click on the link sent by the bot to start playing!

### Errors
- discord.gg/0 - This means the bot doesn't have access to the voice channel you're in, or cannot view it.
- discord.gg/50013 - This means the bot doesn't have `create_invite` permission in your voice channel.

### SideNotes
- Poker is an 18+ game, and it is not advised for under 18 users to play this game. 
- This project is in no way affiliated to Discord or it's games.
- If discord patches up the AppID for this game, then this project will no longer work.
